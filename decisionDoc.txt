Yarn over NPM- Speed
Material UI for table- speed up development with established library
Axios- promise based ++ REST API library I'm most familiar with. Easy to use
Added a second page- Ease of use for data, thought it looked better than just listing all the data
Created proxy server- issues with rate limiting
