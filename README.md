## Active Campaign Interview Page

The following decisions were made based on the available date:

The Contact Name is determined by combining the First and Last Name of the list of contacts from the end point provided.

The Total Value is determined by examining all of the deals in a contact and adding the values of the deals. 

The Australian Dollar is differentiated by the US Dollar with an "A"

The Location is determined by looking at the GeoAddress of the contact and displaying the city and country.

Deals is determined by the total number of deals in a contact

Tags are determined by looking at current Contact tags and displaying the Tag

The 3 dot menu in the uppercorner would allow a user to perform table-wide actions such as exporting it.

The Action Button on the far right is only visible when a row is selected. A user is able to perfom some actions such as emailing the contact or removing that row

Rows are sorted by clicking on the header, but only Contact and Total Value are rows that can be sorted

Rows have an avatar that defaults to their initials if no working picture is provided

Rows can be checked by clicking anywhere in the row, not just the checkbox

Data that has no value (City, amount) will display nothing in the table. The only exception is "deals" which will display 0.
